# Amazon Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights. It includes evaluating the existing code, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance the analysis and derive more meaningful insights.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze sales data and identify key trends and patterns.
- To evaluate and enhance existing analysis methods and models.
- To derive actionable insights for better decision-making.
- To provide recommendations based on the findings.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Product Information**: Names, IDs, categories, and descriptions.
- **Sales Metrics**: Discounted prices, actual prices, and discount percentages.
- **Customer Feedback**: Ratings, review titles, and review content.
- **Other Features**: Temporal trends and category-wise analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights from the EDA include:
- **Sales Distribution**: Analysis of sales trends across categories.
- **Temporal Trends**: Identifying how sales vary over time.
- **Ratings Impact**: Understanding the relationship between ratings and sales.
- **Data Quality**: Detection of outliers and missing data.

## Data Wrangling
Steps taken to prepare the data:
1. Handling missing values.
2. Normalization of numerical features.
3. Encoding of categorical variables.
4. Outlier detection and removal.

## Statistical Methods and Models
The project implements:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: For trend analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: To explore relationships between variables.
- **Predictive Modeling** (if applicable): Includes regression and classification techniques for forecasting.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes several impactful visualizations:
1. Distribution of discounted prices.
2. Distribution of ratings.
3. Heatmaps to show correlations between variables.
4. Scatter plots to explore relationships (e.g., discounts vs. ratings).

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Utilize high-performing categories for targeted promotions.
- Leverage customer ratings to improve product visibility.
- Explore additional data sources to enhance insights.
- Use advanced models like XGBoost or Random Forest for better predictions.
